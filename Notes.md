There's a connection between mitochondria and aging, more specifically developmental biological speed. Autonomous programmable mitochondria are nanobots capable of existing and traveling to any location in the body. Simple enough to version control, modifications can be self-sourced and modified. These are the attributes of a potential tool to solve many problems and to enhance the body.

Maybe I can improve the structural integrity of the mitochondria before extraction to improve yield.

How to measure viability: focus on mitochondrial transplantation, find the protocol that might work the best.
Create a rank-ordered list of extraction protocols.
You can make predictions on the organs most likely to have age-related declines just by looking at cell turnover and mutation rates.

Perhaps increasing mitochondrial density would allow for higher rates of energy production and growth rates, which could be confirmed in yeast, perhaps also through alcohol concentrations.

If mitochondrial energy production occurs in the bloodstream, would the ATP enter cells? I'm pretty sure the answer is no, because ATP would decompose into ADP, which would have other effects like pain modulation.

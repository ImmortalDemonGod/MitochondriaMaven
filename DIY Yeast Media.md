The simplest and cheapest sources for the components of yeast media often involve using common household ingredients and some readily available supplements:

**Simple homemade yeast medium:**

1. Boil 2-3 potatoes until soft.
2. Mash the potatoes and add a teaspoon of sugar.
3. Dissolve a teaspoon of ammonium sulfate in warm water and add to the potato mixture.
4. Dilute the mixture with water to the desired consistency.
5. Adjust the pH to slightly acidic (around 4.5-6.5) if needed.
6. Sterilize the medium by boiling or using a pressure cooker.
7. Once cooled, inoculate with your yeast culture.


**Carbon source:**

* **Sugar:** Regular table sugar (sucrose) or brown sugar are excellent sources of carbon for yeast. Molasses, honey, or maple syrup can also be used.

**Nitrogen source:**

* **Potatoes:** Boiled and mashed potatoes provide a good source of nitrogen and other nutrients.
* **Bread:** Stale or leftover bread can be soaked in water and used as a nitrogen source.
* **Ammonium sulfate:** This is a common fertilizer that can be found at garden stores and provides a readily available nitrogen source.

**Minerals and Vitamins:**

* **Vegetable broth:** Vegetable broth made from scraps or bouillon cubes can provide a variety of minerals and vitamins.
* **Fruit juice:** Diluted fruit juice, especially from citrus fruits, can be a source of vitamins and trace elements.
* **Brewer's yeast:** This is a good source of B vitamins and can be found in health food stores or online.

**Water:**

* **Tap water:** Regular tap water is usually suitable for yeast growth, but if your water is highly chlorinated, it's best to let it sit out overnight or boil it to remove the chlorine.

**Optional additions:**

* **Egg shells:** Crushed egg shells can provide calcium and other minerals.
* **Epsom salt:** This can provide magnesium sulfate.

**Important Considerations:**

* While these simple sources can support yeast growth, they might not be as precise or consistent as commercially prepared media.
* The growth rate and yield might be lower compared to using optimized media.
* If you need specific growth characteristics or are working with a sensitive yeast strain, commercially prepared media might be a better option.

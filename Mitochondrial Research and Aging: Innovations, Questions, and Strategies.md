### Key Questions and Considerations
1. **Mitochondrial Energy Production**:
   - If energy production occurs in the bloodstream, would ATP enter cells? Likely no, as ATP degrades into ADP, which could cause other effects like pain modulation.
2. **ATP and Mitochondria**:
   - Are there ATP transport proteins?
   - Are ATP injections available?
3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - How do human mitochondria differ from those of other organisms?  
4. **Stress and Aging**:
   - What is the rate of aging as a function of chronic and acute stress?
5. **Bioreactor Design**:
   - How are bioreactors made for mammalian vs. bacterial cultures?  
6. **Mitochondrial DNA and Aging**:
   - What is the relationship between mitochondrial DNA and aging?
